## What is it?
bradleyhodge.ca is my professional Web-Developer Portfolio. This is where I can showcase all my projects and skills.

## What is it built with?
This site is built using the `React` framework. It also incorporates `React's` `Styled-Components` for the styling. Soon `Styled-components` will be used exclusively for the CSS styling on this application, thus creating Components that are entirely independent.

## What will be added to the website?
In the future, I will be adding full-stack capabilities with `Node.js` and `Express`. To create a more dynamic website, I will also incorporate a `MySQL` database.
